# FluorescentSeries

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/romainFr/FluorescentSeries.jl.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/romainFr/FluorescentSeries.jl)

FluorescentSerie objects are just AxisArrays with a time axis and a region of interests (ROI) axis. This package for now just builds them from ROI (list of ROIs or images with few levels) and images, and contains one utility to transform them into DF/F.
